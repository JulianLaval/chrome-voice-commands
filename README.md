# Chrome Voice Commands 
For the first time ever, enjoy the full power of voice commands on Google Chrome!

In its current state, Google Chrome only supports "voice searches" from new tabs and the Google.com homepage. Whilst that's already pretty cool, I felt it'd be cooler to build a fully-fledged voice command system, accessible from (almost) any webpage, and allowing for more than simply Googling what you ask it.
                                    
Please note that this Google Chrome extension is in development, and as such may be buggy. If you find any bugs, please report them!

This software is free to use and modify under the MIT license.

## Usage
This is extension is currently only available for Google Chrome, and can be downloaded directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps). Additionally, you can also load the unpacked extension in Developer Mode.

Voice commands can be triggered in a number of ways:

- By clicking the ![Browser icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulianLaval/chrome-voice-commands/master/img/browser-icon19.png) in your Settings bar
- More conveniently, via the `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`F` combination (or equivalent on Mac)
- Finally, if hotwording is enabled, by simply say `"Ok Chrome"` at any time (coming soon!)

## Supported commands

The extension presently supports a number of command, with more in the works. If you have any additional suggestions, please get in touch!
